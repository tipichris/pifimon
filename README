pifimon is a Perl script for monitoring wireless access points under
Linux. It relies on iwlist. It parses the output of iwlist and 
presents the results in neater way.

On launching it presents a continuously updating list of visible
access points. One AP can then be selected to display a histogram
of signal strength.

pifimon provides a means to extend it to support different wireless
card drivers or versions of iwlist. See Drivers/README.

Synopsis
========

pifimon [-d driver] [interface]

 -d  use a driver from the Drivers directory. driver
     is the filename without the .pm extension

     interface is the interface to monitor. 

Default values for both driver and interface can be set by changing 
the values of $default_if and $default_driver in the configuration 
section of the script.

NB because `iwlist scan` requires root priviliges, pifimon must also
be run as root.

Requirements
============
A linux system with working wireless card
iwlist
Perl
CPAN modules:
  Term::Size (Ubuntu package: libterm-size-perl)
  Term::ReadKey (Ubuntu package: libterm-readkey-perl)
