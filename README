Pifimon is a Perl script for monitoring wireless access points under
Linux. It relies on iwlist, part of the wirelesstools package. It 
parses the output of iwlist and presents the results in a neater way.

On launching it presents a continuously updating list of visible
access points. One AP can then be selected to display a histogram
of signal strength.

Pifimon provides a means to extend it to support different wireless
card drivers or versions of iwlist. See Drivers/README.

Usage
=====

pifimon [-d driver] [interface]

 -d  use a driver from the Drivers directory. driver
     is the filename without the .pm extension

     interface is the interface to monitor. 

Default values for both driver and interface can be set by changing 
the values of $default_driver and $default_if in the configuration 
section of the script.

*NB* because `iwlist scan` requires root priviliges, Pifimon must also
be run as root.

*Cell list screen*

The cell list screen displays a list of all cells that have been seen
since Pifimon was started, or since the list was reset. Cells not 
currently visible will have no signal strength reported.

Enter a cell number followed by enter/return to monitor that cell and
display a histogram of its signal strength.

Press one of the following keys for other actions:
L - toggle looping (continuous updating of the cell list)
R - reset the list
N - view the next screen in the list, if the list extends over more
    than one screen
P - view the previous screen in the list
Q - quit

*Histogram screen*

The histogram screen displays a histogram representing the signal
strength for the chosen cell. Signal strength is given, either in 
dBm or as a percentage, depending on the driver.

Press Q to quit and return to the cell list screen.

Requirements
============
A linux system with working wireless card
iwlist
Perl
CPAN modules:
  Required:
    Term::ReadKey (Ubuntu package: libterm-readkey-perl)
  Recommended:
    Term::Size (Ubuntu package: libterm-size-perl)

Without Term::Size the console will be assumed to be 24 rows high and
the histogram will not be adjusted to fit if it isn't.

Installation
============
Make sure your system meets the requirements (see above). If you need
to install CPAN modules use something like

  cpan install Term::Size

or on Ubuntu, use apt-get:

  apt-get install libterm-size-perl

Then unpack the tarball, eg:

  tar -xzvf tipichris-pifimon-xxxxx.tar.gz
or
  tar -xzvf pifimon-xxx.tar.gz

That's about it.
