Improved error checking

## CHANGE OF API ##
A change to the API for writing drivers. Methods now return
values, rather than setting the values directly.

Added some handling of exceptions to ensure ReadMode is
always reset before dieing.

Removed need for  Term::Size, making use of functions in
Term::ReadKey instead. Term::Size

been displayed text at the bottom of the static cell list
(looping off) is not visible.

Added ability to do a simulated scan using a file dumped
out from iwlist. Useful for creating drivers
