WRITING DRIVERS FOR PIFIMON

Pifimon uses an inbuilt package, Iwlist, to parse the output of the 
iwlist command. Drivers for different cards / versions of iwlist 
consist of packages which extend Iwlist and override some of its
methods.

A driver named foo should be placed in the file Drivers/foo.pm and 
should define a package Iwlist::foo which extends Iwlist.

Whilst you can override any of Iwlist's methods, the ones you're most
likely to need to override are listed below. The default methods all
relate to the Broadcom wl driver, because that's what I have on the 
laptop I developed pifimon on. In most cases a driver will only need
to override one or two methods, if any.

init_re
=======
This method sets the value of the regular expressions used to identify
the lines in iwlist output that contain the information we're after. It
must set values for the following keys of $self->{'re'}: cell, essid, 
key, quality, enctype, authtype, frequency. Lines identified by these
regular expressions are passed to the methods listed below.

Returns 1

getsigunits
===========
Returns a string indicating the type of units that the driver returns
signal strength in. Either dbm (for dBm) or pct (for percentage).

getMacID
========
Takes as an argument the line identified by the regular expression in
$self->{'re'}->{'cell'} and returns the cell's MAC id.

---
The following methods all take as an argument a line from iwlist output
identified by the relevent regular expression, and return a value (or 
values) extracted from that.

handleName
==========
Returns the cell's ESSID

handleKey
=========
Returns 'on' or 'off', depending on whether encryption is in use.

handleQuality
=============
Returns an array of two values, link quality and signal strength.
Quality is not used by Pifimon

handleEncType
=============
Returns a string indicating the encryption type and version in use
Note that encryption is assumed to be WEP unless this method is 
called and returns something else.

handleAuthType
==============
Returns the type of authentication supported
(not used by Pifimon)

handleChannel
=============
Returns the channel being used
